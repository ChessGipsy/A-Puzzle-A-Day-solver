## What is this?

‚ÄúA-Puzzle-A-Day‚Äù is a wooden calendar puzzle consisting of eight polyomino
pieces and an irregular 43-cell board.  
For any requested date (e.g. **6 July**) the goal is to place every piece so
_that_ the month cell **July** and the day cell **6** remain visible while all
other cells are covered.

This repo provides a **stand-alone Python 3 solver** that:

* accepts a date on the command line  
  `python apuzzle_solver.py July 6`
* searches for a valid tiling (Algorithm X / exact cover)
* prints
  * machine-readable placement data
  * an ASCII drawing of the finished board
  * statistics (number of tries, elapsed time)

No external dependencies ‚Äî pure standard library.
