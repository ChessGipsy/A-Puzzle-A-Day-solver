## What is this?

You know that wooden calendar puzzle with eight funky polyomino pieces?  
The goal is to cover a board of 43 squares so that **exactly twoâ€”one month cell
and one day cellâ€”stay visible**, forming any date you choose (e.g. **6 July**).

This repo contains a **drop-in Python 3 solver** that:

* Accepts a date on the command line (`python geopuzzle_solver.py July 6`)
* Finds a valid tiling (if one exists) using Algorithm X (exact cover)
* Prints:
  * Machine-readable placement data
  * An ASCII drawing of the fitted board
  * Search statistics (tries + run-time)

No external dependencies, pure standard-library code.
